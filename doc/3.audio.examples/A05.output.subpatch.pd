#X text 27 423 The [output~] abstraction is in the 'extra' folder (aka 'standard path') \, so we use [declare -stdpath ./] to make sure Pd finds it., f 73;
#X text 27 267 In this and subsequent patches \, we'll use the [output~] abstraction to control overall amplitude. Use the slider to control horizontally from 0 (silence) to 1 (full blast). Note \, however \, that a quartic function is applied. In this example \, you can't actually push the output amplitude all the way up without clipping. You'll know you're clipping if \, instead of an A major chord \, you hear a single \, distorted tone two octaves down. The clipping happens at Pd's last stage of audio output. Audio signals internal to Pd have essentially no level limit., f 73;

#X text 27 388 The output control automatically starts DSP whenever you touch the sider. You can use the "mute" toggle to turn mute on or off., f 73;
